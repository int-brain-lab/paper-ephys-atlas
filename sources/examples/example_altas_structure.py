The Allen atlas organisation has 3 main components, see the
atlas structure table: https://github.com/int-brain-lab/ibllib/blob/master/ibllib/atlas/allen_structure_tree.csv

1.  The row index 0-1-2-3...-1327 of the table (on github, it start with 'void' on i_row = 2 ;
    but you should think it starts at 0). This is called "label" in the IBL atlas code below.
2.  The Allen ID, e.g. 0-997-8 ... (see column 'id' in the table) ; this is a unique identifier number per brain region
    entry in the Allen atlas
3.  The acronym of the brain region, e.g. void-root-... (see column 'name' in the table)

Note on the value 2434:
The acronym table index: https://github.com/int-brain-lab/ibllib/blob/master/ibllib/atlas/allen_structure_tree.csv

The 'onl' acronym is on row index 1107
To differentiate right and left hemisphere, these rows are actually doubled in the code (-> size 2655)
(and assigned a Â± sign depending on the hemisphere)

So index  1107  , and   1327 + 1107 = 2434   will both refer to 'onl' but each in left/right hemisphere.
